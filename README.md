# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
- We built a romantic novel cover generator. It has the abilities to generate a novel page from an existing set of sourced images as well as giving the user the ability to create their own novel with title and subtitles. They can also save these instances for later enjoyment. If they no longer want to reference their novels they can erase the cover by double clicking.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
They have to fork from James W github since he had the original repository, then clone the file down to their terminal ( local). Lastly open up the file with open index.html.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)
The save function was the coolest feature that spanned many different abilities< photo showed seperately.
### Context:

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Learning goals first DOM and JS interaction. First group project balancing partnership. Research material we didn't know. See how interactive jS can make a site. relationship between classes and intergrating logic in function building.
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
1. Getting the site to work 2. seeing the interaction and making something 3. Accessing HTML element and changing them solved by research, cohort out reach, seeing examples, trial and error.
